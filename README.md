# Introduction
Right away, why did I make this thing? its purpose is to make it easier for me to use keyboard shortcuts with just one key. Initially I wanted to use AutoHotkey but it seemed useless because some keys are rarely used, so I just used Arduino as the base program to make it more simple. I set each key from F2-F5 so that it can be set to keyboard shortcuts in programs like OBS, Discord, Visual Studio Code, and others. You can use AutoHotkey if you want and make it look more powerful and advanced macropad.
