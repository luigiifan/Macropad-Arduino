# Introduction
Why did I make this thing? its to make it easier for me to use keyboard shortcuts with just one key. I set each key from F2-F5 so that it can be set to keyboard shortcuts in programs such as OBS, Discord, VSCode, etc. You can use AutoHotkey if you want to make it look more advanced.

# Materials
